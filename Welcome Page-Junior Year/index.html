		<h2> Introduction </h2>
		<p> My love for technology began as a child so I knew I would work in the technology 
			industry from a young age. I began coding in my Digital Design course using Scratch 
			when I was high school. After completing Digital Design, I took a Web Development course 
			where I learned HTML and CSS. During this time, I earned my certifications for HTML Web 
			Development, Microsoft Office Word, and Microsoft Office PowerPoint. </p>
		<br>
		
		<!------------------ Paragraph 2 ---------------->
		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p> I am senior at Kennesaw State University majoring in computer science and minoring in 
			mechatronics engineering. I chose computer science as my major to strengthen my programming 
			skills and become more familiar with back-end programming languages such as Java and C++. I like 
			computer science because it gives me the ability to explore a variety of disciplines within 
			the computing field. I chose to minor in mechatronics engineering because I wanted to learn 
			the basic fundamentals of engineering and robotics. Combining these areas of technology 
			made me realize that I enjoy front-end development, web development, and 
			artificial intelligence. </p>
		<br>
		
		<!------------------- Paragraph 3 --------------->
		<h2> Future Plans </h2>
		<p> After completing my undergraduate degree, I plan to obtain my master's degree. 
			I would like to obtain a master's degree in robotics and autonomous systems or another
			similar degree. I have passion for traveling so I plan to obtain my degree abroad. I will more
			than likely continue my studies at a graduate school based in the United Kingdom. The 
			graduate school I am interested in at the moment is 
			<a href = "https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/"> The Univerisity of Plymouth </a>. If not the United Kingdom, 
			then Switzerland or Germany would be good candidates for graduate school. </p>
		<br>
		
		<!------------------- Paragraph 4 --------------->
		<h2> Hobbies </h2>
		<p> In my free time I enjoy reading, coding, cooking, and watching Marvel movies.
			My favorite genres to read include fiction, fantasy, and comics. I code in my free time so I 
			can strengthen my coding skills and learn new languages outside of class time. Marvel is my 
			favorite superhero universe. It is also part of the reason that I began coding. 
			I watched Iron Man when I was 8 years old and I amazed that he could so many things 
			by using engineering and coding. </p>
